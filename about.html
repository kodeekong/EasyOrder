    <p class="info">Magic Maple Cuisine, or MMC for short, was founded in the good old days of April 1436. MMC has always specialized in creating the best product with maple known to mankind. At first, MC started out as a small maple refinery where we made simple syrup or simple small dishes like maple bread or maple sugar.</p>

    <p class="info">In 1744, our ancestors started a medium-sized restaurant for the time, and they started making more maple things like maple beef, maple bread, maple soup, maple syrup, and things of that nature like maple ale. This is the time when MMC became something bigger than itself and what our bloodline would have ever thought before this moment.</p>

    <p class="info">In 1980, MMC became a national headline for fine dining based on the fact that everyone wanted sweet food. thus making MMC have to become a multi-restaurant company with more than one location. During this time, the menus have seen drastic changes as well as drastic design changes. getting rid of the old-fashioned. Also during this time, a maple mafia had come along and "purchased" the company. He, along with his maple goons, took MMC to new heights with commercials, ads, and every other way you can promote a business. which is the main reason MMC is where it is today.</p>

    <p class="info">In 2020, after nearly 600 years of business, hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of people will come try our cuisine in our three open restaurants around Canada. The history behind MMC is truly magic; the culture around our restaurants is very pleasing; the vibe, you can say, is extremely uplifting and calming; our restaurants are meant to bring happiness to anyone who takes a bite of our food.</p>
